# Code Example
#
# This is the very skeletal beginning of an implementation of a game
# called Adventure from 1980.  In Adventure, you control a single-colored,
# rectangular-shaped player, which you move around the screen by manipulating
# a joystick -- or, in our case, by holding down the arrow keys on the
# keyboard instead.
#
# Still we were mainly interested in becoming acclimated to handling
# keyboard inputs, we didn't take the game very far; all we can do is
# move the player around the screen with the arrow keys.  But this got
# us into a few things that we needed in PyGame, which will be of use to
# you in Project #5.

# We'll define some global constants, to introduce names for what would
# otherwise be "magic numbers" in our code.  Naming constant values with
# something that says what they're going to be used for is a good habit
# to get into.  (People read programs, and it helps if they understand
# the "why" of those programs.)

_FRAME_RATE = 30

# We'll use the same basic pattern that we used in our previous example,
# which is a pretty nice way to organize a PyGame-based game, but that
# still keeps separate parts of it separate.  Rather than one giant
# game loop that includes everything, we're instead breaking our game
# down into separate methods that handle events, draw our frame, and
# so on.
#
# Since a lot of what was done below is similar to the previous example,
# I'll mostly use comments to illustrate what's new here.
