# adventure_game2.py

# ICS 32 Spring 2018
# Code Example
#
# This version of our Adventure game added two features:
#
# (1) We replaced the single-colored, rectangular player with an image
#     of a Pekingese instead.
# (2) When the user presses the Enter/Return key, we played a sound of
#     that Pekingese barking.
#
# One big improvemnet I've made here, which we didn't see in lecture,
# is doing less work with the image.  We load the image from a file
# called "gray_peke.png", then scale it (i.e., proportionally change
# its size to fit into the rectangular area where we draw our player).
# But that scaled image is actually the same in every frame, *except*
# when we change the size of the window.  So a better approach, which
# I'm doing here, is to do this:
#
# * Load the image initially and store it.
# * The first time you draw it, scale it once and store the scaled
#   version, as well.
# * Keep the scaled version and, whenever it's available, use it
#   without re-scaling.
# * When the size of the window changes, throw away the scaled version,
#   which will trigger re-scaling the next time we draw a frame.
